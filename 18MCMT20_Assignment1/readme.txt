Imports Used:
1) Numpy
2) Matplotlib
3) Math
4) Time

Exceptional cases:
1) Widrow Hoff is not converging - i.e, zero error is not achieved. One of the point in data set is not classified properly and hence it is taking 5000 epochs totally. But the decision boundary is clearly seperating all the points.
2) Please run all the cells in sequence otherwise results may not come as expected.
